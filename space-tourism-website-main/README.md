# Space tourism website

![Design preview for the Space tourism website coding challenge](./preview.jpg)




## The challenge

the project is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local `data.json` file for the different page data. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate `.html` files.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information



## Where to find everything

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.
